### Estimating HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) Using 24-Hour Insulin Dosage

The code attempts to estimate insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) for insulin-dependent diabetics when fasting insulin levels are not available.  
It uses the daily basal insulin dosage and fasting glucose levels as inputs.  
Please be cautious, as several assumptions are made (such as the insulin clearance rate), so the results should be taken with a large grain of salt.
